    <h1>RAHUL DRAVID (1996–2012)</h1>
    <h3>the wall</h3>

    <hr>
    <p><strong>Rahul Sharad Dravid, "The Wall", former Indian cricketer and captain, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket and probably one of the last classical Test match batsmen.</strong> </p>
    <p>Rahul Dravid batted exactly like the person he is: stately and upright, dignity and poise his two shoulders, standing up to everything coming at him with minimum fuss. He picked his shots carefully, almost like he was weighing the risk for fear of letting himself and his side down. There was little about him that was flamboyant - there isn't with an oak - and patiently, brick by brick, he built giant edifices. He is a good man and he batted like a good man.</p>
    <p>It was but a feather that prevented him from getting a century on debut at Lord's. He would have liked it, for he has this sense of history about him. He would have wanted to be on that honours board, and 15 years later he inscribed his name there with a Dravid special. Every time Rahul Dravid found a glitch in his batting, he did everything he could to correct it. Even when it required superhuman effort.</p>
    <p>Dravid, in his classic self-effacing way, had confessed to being, for most part, an on-side player. The bowlers had come to know of his strengths and had stopped feeding him on his legs. He had to find another way to score runs, he admitted. Which was how he became one of cricket's outstanding off-side batsmen.He was restrained in celebration, just as he was restrained in disappointment - exactly as the true gentleman should be. And yet his emotional self-control co-existed with fierce competitiveness and national pride.</p>
